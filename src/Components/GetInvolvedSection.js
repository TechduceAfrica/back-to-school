                <h3>How to get Involved with our charity</h3>
                <p>
                    There are so many ways you can use your time and 
                    skills to get involved with charity and help some 
                    of the world’s poorest communities to build a 
                    brighter future. Whether it’s volunteering at 
                    community events, hosting your own fundraiser, 
                    taking part in a sponsored activity or selling 
                    cakes to your friends, your effort will be making 
                    an incredible difference to children’s lives.

                        Become a Back To School volunteer. 
                        Join our army of volunteers, learn new skills, 
                        meet new people and help us reach more out of school children.

                        Fundraise

                    <p>
                        Fundraisers play a critical role in keeping the flame of 
                        Back to School glowing. These selfless givers raise money 
                        to provide daily meals for hungry schoolchildren all 
                        across the world. From a young child using their own 
                        money to help others to community-wide fundraising efforts, 
                        every single one of them is inspiring. The lives of 
                        children in some of Nigeria's poorest states can be 
                        improved significantly as a result of your efforts.
