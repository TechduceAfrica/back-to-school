                    Tackling low education rate using a simple idea

                    We offer free, high-quality education to children who cannot 
                    attend school due to economical or other reasons at Back to School. 
                    We want to lower primary dropout rates and increase access to 
                    education for all children. We give children and their families 
                    educational resources and opportunity to raise education rates. 
                    We think every child has the right to education.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We provide books, school supplies, and educational 
                    toys to needy children through our programs. 
                    We also offer scholarships and mentorship 
                    programs to help kids succeed in school.
