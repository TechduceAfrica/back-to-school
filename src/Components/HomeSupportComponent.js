                <p>
                    Our activities and efforts have helped needy people 
                    and communities. We have improved education, 
                    healthcare, hunger, poverty, and environmental 
                    sustainability. Individual donations, business 
                    sponsorships, and foundation grants have funded this. 
                    We appreciate any donation, big or small. 
                    We can improve the future together.
